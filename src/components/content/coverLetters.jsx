      <p><strong>Hiring Manager / Team,</strong></p>
      <p>I’m excited to apply for a position at your company. I bring a background in web development, design, video editing, and community organizing, paired with a lifelong passion for games, technology, and creativity. Whether assisting customers, supporting a project, or lending a hand wherever needed, I approach each task with reliability, curiosity, and enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from FullStack Academy with a Full-Stack Development certificate. Through that program, I learned how to take ideas from concept to completion: designing user flows, writing clean, efficient code, and collaborating closely with teammates to deliver projects under tight deadlines.</p>
      <p>Alongside my technical skills, I’ve spent over a decade across multiple industries, from retail and food service to IT management. These experiences strengthened my communication, adaptability, and problem-solving skills, giving me confidence in both customer-facing and technical environments.</p>
      <p>I would love the opportunity to contribute my mix of technical ability, creative energy, and dedication to your team. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can help your company grow and succeed.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
      <p>Nick Vila</p>

      <p>I’m excited to apply for a position at {companyName}.
